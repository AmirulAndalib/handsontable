# Supported browsers

Handsontable supports the most popular desktop and mobile browsers, such as Chrome, Safari, Firefox, Edge, Opera, and others.

[[toc]]

## Overview

We test Handsontable on **two latest versions** of every modern browser, both on [desktop](#supported-desktop-browsers) and [mobile](#supported-mobile-browsers).

We run our tests in [BrowserStack](https://www.browserstack.com/), and on a number of physical desktop and mobile devices.

In addition to running unit and end-to-end tests, we focus on two crucial factors: performance and accuracy of the user interface.

## Supported desktop browsers

Handsontable supports the following desktop browsers:

| Windows | macOS   |
| ------- | ------- |
| Chrome  | Chrome  |
| Firefox | Firefox |
| Edge    | Edge    |
| Opera   | Opera   |
|         | Safari  |

Handsontable 11.x is the long-term support (LTS) version for Internet Explorer 11 and Edge Legacy (the non-Chromium version of Edge), until the end of 2023.

## Supported mobile browsers

Although Handsontable is designed primarily for desktop, many of its features work on mobile too. For more details, see [Mobile support](@/guides/technical-specification/mobile-support.md).

Handsontable supports the following mobile browsers:
