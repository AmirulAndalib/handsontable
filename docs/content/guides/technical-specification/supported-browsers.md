# Supported browsers

Handsontable supports the most popular desktop and mobile browsers, such as Chrome, Safari, Firefox, Edge, Opera, and others.

## Overview

We test Handsontable on **two latest versions** of every modern browser, both on [desktop](#supported-desktop-browsers) and [mobile](#supported-mobile-browsers).

We run our tests in [BrowserStack](https://www.browserstack.com/), and on a number of physical desktop and mobile devices.

In addition to running unit and end-to-end tests, we focus on two crucial factors: performance and accuracy of the user interface.

## Supported desktop browsers
