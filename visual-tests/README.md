# Handsontable visual testing

To avoid unintended changes to Handsontable's UI, we use automated visual regression testing.

## Overview

We use the following tools:

| Tool                                                                                                   | Description                                                                                    |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/docs/intro)                                                        | An open-source testing framework backed by Microsoft. We use it to write and run visual tests. |
| [Argos](https://argos-ci.com/docs/visual-testing)                                                      | An external visual testing service. We use it to compare screenshots.                          |
| [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/handsontable/handsontable/blob/develop/.github/workflows/test.yml) | A CI platform. We use it to automate our testing workflows.                                    |

Developers add Playwright visual tests to the `/visual-tests/tests` directory.
Then, on pushing a commit to a pull request's feature branch:
1. The [Visual tests Linter](https://github.com/handsontable/handsontable/actions/workflows/visual-tests-linter.yml)
   workflow checks the code of all the visual tests.
2. As part of the [Tests](https://github.com/handsontable/handsontable/blob/develop/.github/workflows/test.yml) workflow,
   the [Visual tests](https://github.com/handsontable/handsontable/blob/develop/.github/workflows/test.yml#L432-L502)
   job runs all the visual tests and uploads the resulting screenshots to Argos.
3. Argos compares the feature branch screenshots against the `develop` branch screenshots (so-called "golden screenshots").
   It adds a URL with the results to the GitHub Actions log.
4. If Argos detects differences between the screenshots, the **Visual tests** check in GitHub prevents you from merging the PR.
   You can either fix the issue, or accept the changes in Argos.

## Write a visual test

To add a new visual test:
1. On your machine, in the `/visual-tests/tests/` folder, create a `.spec.ts` file.
2. Give your file a descriptive name. This name is used in test logs and screenshot names.
   - ‚úÖ Good: `open-dropdown-menu.spec.ts`.
   - ‚ùå Bad: `my-test-1.spec.ts`.
3. Copy the template from `/visual-tests/tests/.empty-test-template.ts` into your file.
4. Write your test, following the [Playwright docs](https://playwright.dev/docs/writing-tests).
5. Keep your file in the `/visual-tests/tests/` folder.

## Manually run visual tests through GitHub Actions

1. On GitHub, at the bottom of your PR, find the **Visual tests** check. Select **Details**.
2. On the left, next to **Visual tests**, select üîÑ.
3. Select **Re-run jobs**.

## Manually run visual tests locally




## Installation

Install by command `npm install` in the root directory and make sure that before testing you've installed and executed the [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) application.

## Usage

In Github `Visual tests` workflow is launched automatically after `Tests` workflow passed successfully. In local environment you have to launch it manually.

## Testing

Launch `npm run in visual-tests test` in main directory or `npm run test` in `./visual-tests` directory to run all of tests with all of frameworks in all of browsers. After tests screenshots will appear in `./visual-tests/screenshots`.
Launch by command `npx playwright test {{ name of file }}` in `./visual-tests` directory to run specific test, e.g. `npx playwright test mouse-wheel`.

## Upload and compare screenshots

For the screen comparison we use external service (currently it's Argos CI). Argos CI compares screenshots from your branch with the base branch (which currently is `develop`).

In Github screenshots are uploaded automatically after every test.
In local environment upload won't work until you create `.env` file in `./visual-tests/` directory and set variable `ARGOS_TOKEN` there - ask your teammates or supervisor for its value.

```
ARGOS_TOKEN=xxx
```

After that launch `npm run in visual-tests upload` in main directory or `npm run upload` in `./visual-tests` directory to upload all of screenshots. Do not worry, you will not overwrite anything - uploading golden screenshots from base branch (if nothing changed in a meanwhile it's `develop`) is not possible on local environment.

After upload you can find URL to your set of images in console or Github Actions logs as a result of `Visual testing - upload` job (NOTE: add example link when first build from official repo will be ready).

If you open Pull Request and try to merge to the base branch, you will be informed in Github `checks` section if there are detected some differences between images and merge will be not possible until fix or decision that differences were expected (in Argos there is option `Accept this build`).

## Making screenshots

If you want to make screenshot, just copy-paste this line anywhere:
`await page.screenshot({ path: helpers.screenshotPath() });`
From now it will take care about names, browsers, frameworks and paths automatically.

You can make as much screenshots per test as needed (it can be 0 also - we still can test anything without screenshots too), for example:

```
await cell.click();
await page.screenshot({ path: helpers.screenshotPath() });
await anotherCell.click();
await page.screenshot({ path: helpers.screenshotPath() });
```

If you want to make screenshot of specific element, just use given locator instead of `page`, e.g.:

```
const dropdownMenu = page.locator(helpers.selectors.dropdownMenu);
await dropdownMenu.screenshot({ path: helpers.screenshotPath() });
```

## Helpers

There are prepared few helpers, you can find them in `/src/helpers`. Helpers are loaded automatically (if you use `.empty-test-template` file). Not all of them will be necessary for you in writing tests, but for sure few of them would make work easier:

### modifier
Returns modifier key - CTRL / Meta depending on system. It can be useful e.g. if you want to copy-paste something.

Example:
```
// copy cell content
await page.keyboard.press(`${helpers.modifier}+c`);
```

### isMac
Returns information if test is launched on Mac or not.

Example:
```
if (helpers.isMac) {
  // do something
}
```

### findDropdownMenuExpander({ col: number })
Returns button to expand dropdown menu in column specified by number.

Example:
```
const changeTypeButton = table.locator(helpers.findDropdownMenuExpander({ col: 2 }));
await changeTypeButton.click();
```

### findCell(options = { row: number, cell: number, cellType: 'td / th' }) {
Returns given cell in main table. You can specify row, column and type of cell `td` or `th`.

Example:
```
const cell = helpers.tbody.locator(helpers.findCell({ row: 2, cell: 2, cellType: 'td' }));
await cell.click();
```
